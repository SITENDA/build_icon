C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Data

SET GLOBAL require_secure_transport=OFF;


Execute the following query in MYSQL Workbench

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Bakiriisa1.';

Where root as your user localhost as your URL and password as your password

Then run this query to refresh privileges:

flush privileges;

Try connecting using node after you do so.

If that doesn't work, try it without @'localhost' part.
